 Gif Me a Break - Project 1 

 This app will return gifs to the client on request. Trending gifs, random gifs, and through specified searches. It solves the problem of looking for the right gifs for the right time. 

 The API used for this site is [Giphy Site]("http://developers.giphy.com").  It pulls from the API from 3 different endpoints and puts them on display. 
 
 The site will feature 3 different search methods for Gifs. The first is through a specified search. The second is through a button that retrieves trending gifs and the third retrieves random gifs from the Giphy database.  

 MVP
 The site will need to pull at least 3 times from the same API. It must also feature a responsive design that would display seemlessly on a mobile device.
